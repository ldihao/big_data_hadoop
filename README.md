## Project 1

EC test: https://itxx00.github.io/blog/2017/08/20/hadoop3-ec-test/

To test the functionality of EC, we need

1. Set the replication factor to 1

2. Set an erasure code policy 

3. put a file in the dfs and find its physical path in datanodes

4. remove a block of the file

5. do $hdfs fsck /my/directory/file to recover the file
